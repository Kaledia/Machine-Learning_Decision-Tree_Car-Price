# Machine-Learning_Decision-Tree_Car-Price
Using the Machine Learning Decision Tree Model to predict cars MSRP based on cars characteristics. 
The model DecisionTreeClassifier from python library scikit-learn was used on data of cars sales.
The label is MSRP in dollar and the features are cars' EngineSize, Cylinders, Horsepower, Weight, Length, and MPG_Combined.
The model was trained and tested with a test-size of 0.2, the low score proved that the Decision Tree is not the best model to predict prices based on cars' characteristics. It may be due to the fact that the prediction did not include the cars' make and model. The Decision Tree Graph was generatd.
